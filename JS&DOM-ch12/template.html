            <p>Lose My Head
                    I know that I'm no angel
                    I've seen myself from every angle
                    Now I'm right outside your door
                    Some positive rejection
                    Foreshadowing frustration
                    Feels like I've been here before
                    But I'm saving it all for the morning after
                    Cause I don't need my conscience when I lose my head
                    Got all of my excuses lying in your bed
                    It's like tasting lightning
                    striking and I need you to find me
                    Baby when I lose my head
                    The view from this position
                    Is of my inhibitions
                    Torn apart and scattered on the floor
                    Now am I taking myself too seriously
                    Don't I know by now that eventually
                    All that it takes is to love my mistakes
                    So I'm saving it all for the morning after
                    Cause I don't need my conscience when I lose my head
                    Got all of my excuses lying in your bed
                    It's like tasting lightning
                    striking and I need you to find me
                    Baby when I lose my head
                    There's gotta be a million things that could be said
                    But I don't go for talking when I lose my head
                    Like the pouring rain
                    I can't explain
                    I go insane
                    Baby when I lose my head
                    Baby when I lose my head
                    Saving it up for the morning after
                    Not going to slow down
                    I'm moving faster
                    I'm saving it all for the morning after
                    Cause I don't need my conscience when I lose my head
                    Got all of my excuses lying in your bed
                    It's like tasting lightning
                     striking and I need you to find me
                    here's gotta be a million things that could be said
                    But I don't go for talking when I lose my head
                    Like the pouring rain
                    I can't explain
                    I go insane
                    Baby when I lose my head</p>
